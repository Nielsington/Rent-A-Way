Hi there!

Céline, Yousra, Seppe, Lisa, Jitske (classmates) and me partnered up together to come up with a company and create a website accordingly.
We started off with a brainstorming session in which we came up with the idea of starting up a Rental Company for technology supplies. We wanted to offer a variety of supplies going from renting Robo-pets to gaming hardware, Virtual Reality to peripherals.

The vision for our rental company named <b>Rent-A-Way</b> is that customers can look both in the shop and online for a product they would like to rent. When pressing the 'rent' button, the item will be reserved at our shop. Clients can rent monthly or yearly after paying a deposit which will be returned when returning the product without any damage.
In the rental prices, there's already an insurance included which will protect you from any damage done to the product (not caused by you).
