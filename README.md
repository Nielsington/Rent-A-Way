Hi there!

Céline, Niels, Yousra, Seppe, Lisa and Jitske partnered up together to come up with a company and create a website accordingly.
We started off with a brainstorming session in which we came up with the idea of starting up a Rental Company for Technology suplies. We wanted to offer a variety of suplies going from renting Robo-pets to gaming hardware, Virtual Reality to peripherals.

The vision for our rental company named <b>Rent-A-Way</b> is that customers can look both in the shop or online for a product they would like to rent, press the button 'rent', and the item will be reserved at our shop. We have different Rental options, you can rent monthly or yearly after paying a deposit which you will be getting back when returning the product without any damage.
In the rental prices, there's already an insurance included which will protect you from any damage to the product caused by the system. If that is the case you will be able to return it and take home another one.
